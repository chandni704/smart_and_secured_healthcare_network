# 🏥 Smart and Secured Healthcare Network

### 🔒 A Mini Project on Secure IoT-based Healthcare Infrastructure

> **Team A-3 | Department of Computer Science and Engineering**
> **KLE Technological University, Dr. MSSCET, Belagavi**
> *Guided by  Prof. UV Somanatti*

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an integrated **Smart and Secured Healthcare Network** that combines **IoT automation** with **secure networking protocols** to address the pressing challenges of:

* Securing sensitive patient data,
* Enabling encrypted staff communication,
* Automating fire, smoke, and temperature detection,
* Ensuring network resilience using VPN, firewalls, and OSPF routing.

The solution was designed and tested using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, featuring a modular, scalable architecture tailored to hospital operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* 🔐 Implement role-based **access control** and secure communication.
* 🔥 Enable **IoT-based safety automation** (fire, smoke, gas, temperature).
* 🧑‍⚕️ Support real-time monitoring with secure remote access.
* 📡 Ensure **end-to-end encrypted communication** using VPN with SSH.
* 🧱 Deploy **multi-level firewall protection** and traffic filtering.
* ⚙️ Enable centralized network management and auto-recovery.

## 🧱 System Architecture

The network includes:

* **VPN + SSH encrypted channels**
* **OSPF routing** for optimized packet delivery
* **Firewall** with ACL rules
* **IoT modules** for fire, smoke, and environmental control
* **Modular department setup**: ICU, OT, PACU, General Ward, Billing
